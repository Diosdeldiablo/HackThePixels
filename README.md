# [HACKTHEPIXELS] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Rockstar]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Prarthana M J] - [LBS Institute of Technology for Women,Poojappura.]
- Member 2: [CHANDANA CHANDRAN] - [LBS Institute of Technology for Women,Poojappura.]


### Project Description
[HackThePixels turns ordinary images into streams of 0s and 1s, revealing the hidden data soul of every pixel.
See beyond the picture ‚Äî explore the raw binary and image stats in a fun, hacker-themed way.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Everyone sees an image‚Ä¶ but what if you could see the actual binary bits behind it?
It‚Äôs useless‚Ä¶ but geekily satisfying.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Hack your image. Discover its data soul and see what your pixels are truly hiding.
We built a playful tool that transforms any JPEG into its raw binary view, complete with preview and live image  stats ‚Äî all wrapped in a stylish hacker aesthetic.
It doesn‚Äôt solve a real problem, but it definitely makes exploring image data surprisingly fun!]

Image to Binary Converter Demo

[Screenshot1](https://i.postimg.cc/13sYFgM4/SCREENSHOT1.png)  
This is the initial state of the application before any image upload. The interface includes an "Upload JPEG" button and an empty "Binary View" awaiting input. 

[Screenshot2](https://i.postimg.cc/pLm5qCsS/SCREENSHOT2.png)
This screenshot shows the user browsing for an image file (si.jpg) to upload. The file selection dialog is open, highlighting a smiling emoji image about to be processed by the web app.

[Screenshot3](https://i.postimg.cc/C1xgsPNB/SCREENSHOT3.png )
This screenshot displays the uploaded emoji image (si.jpg) on the left, along with its binary representation in the "Binary View" section on the right. The app also shows image stats like resolution and total bits at the bottom.
